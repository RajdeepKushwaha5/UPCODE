        content: `Welcome to Python! üêç Python is a beginner-friendly, powerful programming language created by Guido van Rossum.

**Why Python?**
- Simple, readable syntax
- Versatile (web, AI, data science, automation)
- Huge community and libraries
- Great for beginners

**Your first Python program:**
\`\`\`python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming!")
\`\`\`

**Fun fact:** Python is named after the British comedy group "Monty Python"! üé≠`,
        codeExample: 'print("Hello, World!")',

            correct: 0,
            explanation: "Perfect! We use print() with parentheses and quotes around the text. Python uses parentheses for function calls."

        title: "Variables and Data Types",
        content: `Variables are like containers that store data. In Python, creating variables is super easy! üì¶

**Creating Variables:**
\`\`\`python
name = "Alice"        # String (text)
age = 25             # Integer (whole number)
height = 5.6         # Float (decimal number)
is_student = True    # Boolean (True/False)
\`\`\`

**Python's Main Data Types:**
- **String**: Text data like "Hello"
- **Integer**: Whole numbers like 42
- **Float**: Decimal numbers like 3.14
- **Boolean**: True or False values

**Variable Naming Rules:**
- Start with letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, numbers, underscores
- Case sensitive (age ‚â† Age)
- Use descriptive names!`,
        codeExample: `name = "Python Learner"
age = 20
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!")`,
        questions: [
          {
            question: "What data type is the value 'Python Programming'?",
            options: ["Integer", "String", "Float", "Boolean"],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Correct! Text enclosed in quotes (single or double) is a String data type in Python."
          },
          {
            question: "Which variable assignment is correct in Python?",
            options: ["25 = age", "age = 25", "age == 25", "set age = 25"],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Right! We assign values to variables using the = operator. The variable name goes on the left, value on the right."
          },
          {
            question: "What data type is the value True?",
            options: ["String", "Integer", "Boolean", "Float"],
            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Excellent! True (and False) are Boolean values in Python, representing logical true/false states."

        title: "Input and Output",
        content: `Let's make our programs interactive! We'll learn how to get input from users and display output. üí¨

**Getting User Input:**
\`\`\`python
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
print(f"Hello {name}! You are {age} years old.")
\`\`\`

**Important Note:** input() always returns a string! To get numbers:
\`\`\`python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Convert to integer
height = float(input("Enter height: "))  # Convert to float
\`\`\`

**F-strings (Formatted Strings):**
\`\`\`python
name = "Python"
version = 3.9
print(f"I'm learning {name} version {version}!")
\`\`\`

F-strings are the modern, clean way to format text in Python! üé®`,
        codeExample: `name = input("Enter your name: ")
favorite_color = input("What's your favorite color? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you {name}! {favorite_color} is a great color!")`,

            options: ["get()", "input()", "read()", "scan()"],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Perfect! input() is the function that reads user input from the keyboard and returns it as a string."
          },
          {
            question: "What data type does input() always return?",
            options: ["Integer", "Float", "String", "Boolean"],
            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Correct! input() always returns a string, even if the user types numbers. We need to convert if we want numbers."
          },
          {
            question: "Which is the modern way to format strings in Python?",
            options: ["% formatting", "f-strings", ".format()", "+ concatenation"],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Great! F-strings (f'Hello {name}') are the modern, readable way to format strings in Python 3.6+."

**Declaring Variables:**

const age = 28;             // Cannot be changed  
var city = "Web City";      // Old way (avoid)
\`\`\`

**Data Types:**
\`\`\`javascript
let text = "Hello World";       // String
let number = 42;               // Number
let decimal = 3.14;            // Number (same type)
let isAwesome = true;          // Boolean
let nothing = null;            // Null
let notDefined;               // Undefined
\`\`\`

**Modern Best Practices:**
- Use \`let\` for variables that change
- Use \`const\` for variables that don't change
- Avoid \`var\` (it's old and confusing)
- Use descriptive variable names`,
        codeExample: `const greeting = "Hello";
